## Introduction

For this assignment we have been asked to store information about three books, at least one of which has more than one author , into an XML file, an HTML table and a JSON file. For this assignment I have chosen the following three books.

## Read XML Format

I have copied the XML form of the data into [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.xml). I will now import the file using the XML library, which has been previously loaded.

```{r xml.import}
xml.url<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.xml"
xml.raw <- xmlParse(getURL(xml.url))
```


I will now use the `xmlToDataFrame` to convert my file to an R DataFrame. 
```{r xml.root}
books.df.fromXML <- xmlToDataFrame(xml.raw)%>% 
  mutate(ISBN10  = as.integer(ISBN10) )
datatable(books.df.fromXML) 
```


## Read HTML Table Format
I have copied the HTML table form of the data into [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.html). 
```{r html.import}
html.url<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.html"
html.raw <- read_html(html.url)
```

I will now use the `html_table` function from the `rvest` library to import the table into a DataFrame. SInce my file has only one table, I can safely choose the first element returned from the `html_table` function. I have also used the `mutate_all` function to replace all empty spaces with NA.
```{r html.table.to.dataframe}
allTablesFromHTML<- html.raw %>%  html_table(fill = T,header = T, trim = T)
books.df.fromHTML <- allTablesFromHTML[[1]] %>% 
  mutate_all(list(~na_if(.,""))) 
```

## Read JSON Format
I have copied the JSON form of the data into [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.json).  In my file I stored the information about the three books in a JSON array. I will use the `fromJSON` function from the `jsonlite` package to parse the file. I have also used the `mutate_all` function to replace all empty spaces with NA.
```{r json.import}
json.url<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%207/books.json"
json.raw <- jsonlite::fromJSON(getURL(json.url))
books.df.fromJSON <- json.raw$books %>% 
  mutate_all(list(~na_if(.,""))) %>% 
  mutate( ISBN10  = as.integer(ISBN10) )
```

## Conclusion and Extra Credit

There are many different ways to obtain data in R, in this assignment we are concerned with JSON, XML files and HTML Tables.  I will use the `all_equals` function to show that the three data frames are in fact equal, bear in mind I did introduce NAs for the JSON and HTML formats where the information was empty. I also cast the ISBN10 column as integers for the XML and JSON formats, the HTML parser did this on its own.

```{r conclusion}

all_equal(books.df.fromHTML,books.df.fromJSON)
all_equal(books.df.fromHTML,books.df.fromXML)

```

## Introduction

We have been asked to import data that has been provided in the image below. I have created a CSV file with the data and posted it to [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%205%20Assignment/week5_assignment.csv).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/c197488cf8aeae85f649cf93edef4562d80b75ef/Week%205%20Assignment/data_image.png)

## Import Data into R from the CSV

I will begin by importing the CSV from GitHub. 

```{r import-csv, message=FALSE}
file <- ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharbans/DATA607_HW/main/Week%205%20Assignment/week5_assignment.csv")
airlineData <- read_csv(file)
```
Please find the data displayed below.

```{r display-raw-csv}
reactable(airlineData)
```
## Tidy Data

In the tidy data format, each observation should be in its own row and each variable in its own column. I will now convert the data from wide format to long by introducing a new variable, `City`. I will also use the spread function to add the status as two separate columns. 

```{r tidy-data}
airlineDataTidy <- airlineData %>% 
  rename(Airline = AIRLINE)

airlineDataTidy <- airlineDataTidy %>% 
  gather( key = "City",value = "NumberOfFlights", 3:7, factor_key = TRUE)

airlineDataTidy <- airlineDataTidy %>% 
  spread(key = Status,value = NumberOfFlights)

airlineDataTidy <- airlineDataTidy %>% 
  mutate(totalNumberofFlights = delayed + `on time` , PropOnTime = `on time`/totalNumberofFlights)
reactable(airlineDataTidy)

```


## Data Analysis

Below I will compare the per-city on-time performance for both airlines. 

```{r city-on-time-performance}
airlineDataTidy %>% 
  select(City, Airline, PropOnTime) %>% 
  arrange(desc(PropOnTime), City ) %>% 
  reactable()
```

Displayed graphically:
```{r city-on-time-performance-graph}
plot1 <-airlineDataTidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=City,y=`on time`,color=Airline)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("City vs Number of On-Time Flights (Fig1)")
plot2 <- airlineDataTidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=City,y=PropOnTime,color=Airline)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("City vs Proportion of Flights On Time (Fig 2)")

grid.newpage()
grid.arrange(plot1,plot2, nrow= 2)
```

Below I will compare the overall on-time performance for both airlines. The data shows that Alaska Airlines on average has less on time flights than AM West. 

```{r airline-on-time-performance}
airlineDataTidy %>% 
  group_by(Airline) %>% 
  summarise( "Number On Time"=sum(`on time`),ProportionOnTime = sum(`on time`)/sum(`on time`,delayed) ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ProportionOnTime)) %>% 
  reactable()
```

## Conclusion
It appears that even though Alaska Airlines has a higher proportion of flights on time for every city,  AM West has the higher proportion of on-time flights. Why is this the case? AM West has the majority of its flights departing from Phoenix which has the highest number of on-time flights. This skews the overall number of flights in favor of AM West when looking at the data as a whole. 

```{r conclusion-table}
airlineDataTidy %>% 
  group_by(City, Airline) %>% 
  summarise( propOnTimeByCity = `on time`/totalNumberofFlights, totalNumberofFlights, .groups = "keep") %>% 
  arrange(desc(propOnTimeByCity) ) %>% 
  reactable()
```
